# LandCoverSegmentation_FYP
This project implements advanced deep learning models for pixel-wise segmentation of high-resolution satellite images into six distinct land cover classes: urban, vegetation, water bodies, forest, agricultural land, and barren land. The goal is to enable automated, accurate, and scalable land cover classification.
